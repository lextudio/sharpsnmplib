-- Bulk File Formats
--

-- There are five bulk transfer file formats:

--   . ASN.1/BER variable bindings - standard BER, just like you'd
--    find it in the varbinds section of a Response PDU.

--   . Bulk binary - a binary form designed for fast, sequential
--    processing and minimum redundancy.

--   . Bulk ASCII - the binary form, mechanically translated to
--    human-readable ASCII.

--   . Variant ASN.1/BER with Checksum - designed for more
--    efficient data encoding to reduce the file size.

--   . Variant Binary with Checksum - designed for speed and
--    file size efficiency.

-- The ASN.1/BER format is identical to SNMP variable bindings, that is,
-- each object has a full OID and a fully tagged value. The file
-- content is similar to what would be obtained with a GetBulk request
-- except that it does not overshoot for uninstantiated values. In
-- other words, the file contains no data at all for scalars or
-- columns that could not be read.

-- The Variant ASN.1/BER is different from the standard ASN.1/BER
-- in the way it encodes each object and the checksum
-- value it attaches at the end of the file. Here
-- is the content structure of the Variant ASN.1/BER file:
--
--  Checksum signature (4 bytes)
--  Data (encoded in ASN.1/BER)
--  Checksum signature (4 bytes)
--  Checksum value (4 bytes)
--
--  Here is an example of how the objects get encoded:
--   1) Common table subidentifier (share among multiple tables)
--   2) Common object subidentifier (share among object instances
--    of a table)
--   3) Object instances
--   Example: to encode ifDescr 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2
--            ifType 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3
--            ifName 1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1
--   using variant ASN.1/BER:
--     1) Common table subidentifier is 1.3.6.1.2.1
--     2) Common object subidentifier for ifDescr and ifType
--      are 2.1.2.2.1
--      Common object subidentifier for ifName is 31.1.1.1
--     3) Object instance for
--        ifDescr is 2.ifIndex
--        ifType is 3.ifIndex
--        ifName is 1.ifIndex
--
--  The content of the the file encoded as:
--     1) 4 bytes checksum signature
--     2) Common table subidentifier encoded as private class
--      OID type
--     3) Common object subidentifier for ifDesc encoded as
--      private class OID type
--     4) ifDescr instance encoded as OID type
--     5) ifDescr value encdoded
--     6) ifType instance encoded as OID type
--     7) ifType value encoded
--     8) Repeat step 4-7 if the table contains multiple rows
--     9) Common object subidentifier for ifName encoded
--    10) ifName instance encoded as OID type
--    11) ifName value encoded
--    12) Repeat step 10-11 if the table contains multiple rows
--    13) 4 bytes checksum signature
--    14) 4 bytes checksum value
--
--    Notes: Step 2 through step 12 are data

-- The Variant Binary with Checksum is designed for fast
-- processing and file size efficiency. The content of the the
-- file is as follow:
--
--  Checksum signature (4 bytes)
--  Data
--  Checksum signature (4 bytes)
--  Checksum value (4 bytes)
--
--  The data is store in 16 bytes blocks. Each block has
--  4 objects. Here is an example of the data:
--    &lt;ifIndex&gt;&lt;vpi&gt;&lt;vci&gt;&lt;uploadCounter&gt;

-- The remainder of this description applies to the bulk binary and bulk
-- ASCII formats, not to the ASN.1/BER format.

-- The file contains two types of fields: tags and data. Tags identify
-- portions of the file and are discussed in detail below. All other
-- information is in data fields.

-- Note: For efficiency and compactness data fields are not tagged
-- with a type. The interpreter of the data must thus know or have
-- access to appropriate MIB syntax descriptions to understand the file.

-- All data fields are positional relative to a tag and every data field
-- has a length prefix. All initial length prefixes are one byte. For
-- any data type the distinguished length value 255 indicates that the
-- data content is null, that is, no data content value was
-- available and there are no additional bytes in the data field.

-- INTEGER data fields include all data that maps to ASN.1 INTEGER,
-- regardless of length and whether signed or unsigned. They have a
-- length prefix value of zero to eight, followed by that many bytes of
-- data, high-order byte first. High order bytes that are all zero are
-- omitted, thus a length of zero indicates a value of zero. For signed
-- numbers, leading bytes of all ones (hex FF) are omitted if the next
-- remaining byte has the high bit on. This implies that the
-- file parser must know the difference between signed and unsigned
-- integers.

-- OCTET STRING values have a length prefix value of zero to two for a
-- subsequent unsigned byte count for the number of bytes in the OCTET
-- STRING itself, which immediately follows the byte count. The byte
-- count can thus range from zero to 65,535.

-- OBJECT IDENTIFIER values have a length of zero to 128, for the number
-- of sub-identifiers. Each subsequent sub-identifier is encoded as an
-- unsigned INTEGER of 0-4 bytes.

-- The bulk binary file layout directly reflects the contents of the
-- cbfDefineFileObjectTable. It has tagged sections corresponding to
-- cbfDefineObjectClass with a few additional tags for utility purposes.
-- A tag is one byte with one of the following values:

--   -2   row
--   -1   prefix
--    0   reserved
--    1   object
--    2   table

-- The prefix tag changes the default OID prefix that is assumed to
-- precede all OIDs that are not MIB object data values. The prefix tag
-- may appear anywhere another tag could appear. A prefix tag is
-- followed by one OID data field. The default prefix is 1.3.6.1.
-- A file need not set the prefix to the default value. Note that
-- when changing the prefix, the default portion must be included
-- at the beginning of the new prefix. Typically the prefix will
-- change for each table or group of scalar objects.

-- An object tag is followed by one OID data field and one data field
-- appropriate to the syntax of the object. This OID is the full
-- OID for the object minus the current prefix.

-- A table tag is followed by one INTEGER data field whose value is the
-- number of columns in the table, as implemented by the agent. This is
-- followed by one OID data field for each column. This is the OID for
-- the column minus the prefix and the instance (typically one
-- subidentifier).

-- The OIDs are then followed by one row for each row in the table.
-- A row starts with a row tag and one OID data field containing
-- only the instance portion of the OIDs for the objects in that row.
-- Following this is one data field of appropriate type for each
-- column.

-- The bulk ASCII form mechanically translates bulk binary into
-- human-readable text.

-- The indicator for a null value is "~".

-- An INTEGER becomes the integer value with a preceding "-" for
-- negative values and no leading zeros.

-- An OCTET STRING becomes the byte values in hexadecimal, lower case,
-- two characters per byte (that is, with leading zeros), no delimiters
-- between bytes.

-- An OBJECT IDENTIFIER becomes the usual dotted decimal form.

-- A tag becomes the tag's name, spelled out fully in lower case,
-- followed by one blank and the data field(s) for the tag, separated
-- by spaces and ending with a carriage return/line feed. All tags
-- are at the beginning of a "line" that is terminated with a carriage
-- return/line feed that immediately precedes the next tag or the end
-- of file.
